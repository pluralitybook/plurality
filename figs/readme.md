# Figures: data and formatting standards

## Data

Every figure in the book should have its own subdirectory in `data/`. The subdirectory should contain a copy of the data used to generate the figure (in CSV format). It should also contain a readme file citing the source of the data and explaining any steps taken to transfer or analyze the data.

## Formatting

Figures should have a white background and black text, gridlines, etc.

The preferred fonts are Arial and Open Sans. Accent colors currently include dark blue (#152B52) and bronze (#966B0F).

The resolution, number of pixels, print size of figures are related mathematically.
Pixels = Resolution (DPI) × Print size (in inches). Figures should have at least 300 DPI and try to meet the following sizing guidelines:

| Size | Image Width | @ 300 DPI | @ 500 DPI |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ----------|
| Small | 90 mm, 3.54 in | 1063 px | 1772 px |
| Medium | 140 mm, 5.51 in | 1654 px | 2756 px |
| Large | 190 mm, 7.48 in | 2244 px | 3740 px |
