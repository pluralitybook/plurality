## Governance goals

To begin reimagining how we can govern together, the Plurality book will be built using the principles that are described in the book. This is a challenge because it is a book about innovation and thus the platforms for the things we want to show do not exist: we are building them as we go in the process of writing the book!

We have several interlocking goals in the design of our management system:

1. **We want to recognize project contributions formally, quantitatively, and democratically.** This can be contrasted to the informal and often confusing methods that are typical to open-source projects.
2. **We want to avoid speculation and financialization** of the devices that will be used to recognize contributions to the project.
3. **We want to demonstrate the ideas of Plurality.** To do this, we will aim to ensure that the direction of the project is determined democratically. Eventually, we want to turn over the maintenance of the project to the community completely.
4. **We want the project to scale smoothly while also ensuring that the systems we use are secured against malicious attacks.** We want to ensure that democratization and decentralization happens gradually and does not occur at the expensive of the integrity of the project’s contents or the community’s values.
