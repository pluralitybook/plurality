# Gov4Git

> [Gov4Git](https://gov4git.org/) (G4G) is an open-source protocol that uses a blockchain-like structure where a ledger of credits is mirrored by the Git repositories of all its members.

---

In contrast to standard blockchains G4G does not include financial incentives for maintenance of the ledger and instead relies on community members to mirror the underlying database for the same reason that they mirror the code of git projects (to participate in the community).

When there is a conflict in the ledger, the governance procedures described below work to resolve these conflicts. The social capitalization table used for allocating PCs will live on a ledger that is maintained by the community through the Gov4Git protocol.
