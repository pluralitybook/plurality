## Translation process

*Reach out to Jacky if there are any questions here*

* English and Traditional Mandarin are considered the root language that will be directly uploaded to the root repository. Translations of other languages will need to be done in forks from the root to decentralize and streamline each community’s independent workflow.

* The point of contact for each community can fork the main branch of [plurality root repository](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality) on GitHub and start adding their translated content in the forked repository.
    * please name the fork with book name + language name for easier recognizability (e.g plurality-japanese)
* Reach out to Jacky or Jason in Discord to get the forked repository verified as an official translation repository to be listed in the root repository’s Readme page [here](https://github.com/pluralitybook/plurality#official-active-translation-repositories)

## Publication workflow

*Reach out to Aki or Jacky if there are any questions here. Many steps are still quite manual, the process should become easier as more people go through them.*

* Start with translating the announcement if its not already translated, and submit it to be added under the different versions of the [announcement in GitHub](https://github.com/alexrandaccio/plurality.net/tree/main/src/site/versions).
