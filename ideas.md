# Some Topic Ideas

## Neural Networks as an example of plurality?
I had the thought that the recent developments in AI, which mostly seem to use neural networks,
could be considered an example of a form of plurality. In that architecture, you have a large number of 
actors (neurons) conforming to a relatively simple set of rules, making relatively simple decisions individually, with
no real hiearchy in the usual sense of the word. Yes, there is a chronological order for the layers,
but there is not one set of neurons trumping others as I understand it. But even though (or perhaps because) the rules 
and the actors are simple, the power of the network to process information is phenomenal.

## The relationships between physics and political economy
Generally, as far as we know all economic entities are subject to physical constraints. This is especially true for
individuals, who are subject to the same 24 hour/day limitations, and a relatively tight distribution of energy and 
and mass. It seems to me that a logical argument for the limitation of central planning vs markets or democratic systems,
is the sheer limit of the processing power of individual actors in terms of these physical constraints. In other words,
with more 'vertical' organizations, there is a lower limit on processing power. This can be compared to the recent trends
in computation to not focus so much on faster processors, but to distribute the processes across more processors. 
I think that there is more to this. For example, I think that there is a physical reason that markets are drawn to 
monopolies or centralization, and that involves these contraints, but I won't get into that too much here, 
because it is another subject. I'm generally a proponent of further exploration of the relationship between physics and 
economics. I did some writing on the subject here: https://ikuhle.com/TEMS.pdf
