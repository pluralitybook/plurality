# Health

### Triumphs and Failures of Health Objectivism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past 75 years the human race has added 25 years to global life expectancy, significantly more than in the previous 10,000 years.  To the extent these advances in human flourishing were mediated by the health system, or through the application of biomedicine, they were achieved primarily through the centralized dissemination of an objectivist model (see Living in a Plural World 03-01) of health and healthcare.  Such models (e.g. 'tropical medicine') were developed and refined through centuries of imperial and colonial governance, but their implementation worldwide was rapidly accelerated following the formation of the United Nations and in particular the World Health Organization (WHO) in the middle of the 20th century:
* In 1967, the Intensified Eradication Programme for smallpox was launched by WHO and 13 years later smallpox was declared eradicated worldwide.
* In 1974, the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization was created, and 15 years later coverage with a set of basic antigens had risen from 10% to 80% worldwide. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 2000, global momentum in health objectivism was given further impetus with the signing of the  Millennium Development Declaration, in which three of the eight goals (4, 5, 6) embodied specific health targets, and three of the others (1, 2, 3) were direct determinants of health:
* In 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was created, and 20 years later 80% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa living with HIV was receiving antiretroviral therapies (75% worldwide). 
* In 2000, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was created and rapidly raised infant coverage with a set of new antigens, and year-2000 levels of child mortality were more than halved by 2020. 
* Finally, as a result of monitoring and the  cultivation of political support, the 2020 level of maternal mortality was reduced by one-third from its 2000 level. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, in the 2 years following the appearance of COVID-19, the share of the world's population having received at least one dose of COVID vaccine rose to greater than 70%.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet darkening clouds are gathering: 
* Progress in health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including vaccine coverage, has stalled or gone into reverse[^UnitedNations].
* Half the world's population still lacks access to a package of essential health services[^UN2016UHCPoliticalDeclaration].
* Catastrophic and impoverishing out-of-pocket payments for healthcare affect hundreds of millions of people[^TrackingUniversalHealthCoverage2023MonitoringReport].
* There is severe COVID-19 vaccine inequality, with no more than 40% of the population vaccinated in some major world regions[^JournalofGlobalHealth2022].
* “Extreme underinvestment” is observed in mental health services[^WorldMentalHealthReport2022].
* Climate hazards threaten to overwhelm health systems[^LancetCountdown].
* Half of global premature deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases[^WHONCDs], costing more than $2 trillion per year[^NCDAlliance].
* 3% or less of the population in many countries have access to basic assistive technologies (wheelchairs, walkers, canes, prosthetic limbs, eyeglasses, white canes, and hearing aids)[^WHOAssistive].

Unlike past successes, these present challenges will not be overcome by biomedicine or health-system-based solutions alone: we will need to transform not only our concept of health and healthcare, but also our conception of health technologies.

### The Importance of Plural Health Agency

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our plural, decentralized, and relational concept of health (Figure 1), the world will still need doctors, nurses, and other health workers to perform their usual services; just as it will need health facilities and laboratories, and vaccines, drugs and medical devices.  But it will need something more: to empower the co-construction of *health agency* on the part of individuals and their pluralities. Jennifer Prah Ruger understands health agency as the promotion of individuals' capabilities to act in their own interests with respect to their own health[^PrahRuger].  While this is a good start, we conceive of health as *primarily* emergent, multiscale, embedded and complex (see Living in a Plural World 03-01).

### Blockers to Healthy Flourishing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blockers to further transformative progress in health can be summarized as:
1. Lack of financing
2. Missing markets
3. Coordination failures
4. Missing communities at all scales
5. Non-aligned incentives
6. Lack of enabling services.

There is no hard boundary between blockers, however, and solutions must be (as the problems are) emergent, multiscale, and complex; existing approaches are mostly patches, mired in out-of-date thinking, and stasis and apathy reign mostly unopposed.  Yet, if we are successful in addressing these blockers, gains in global healthy life expectancy of at least an additional 20 years are within reach, and many if not all of the 'darkening clouds' referred to above will dissipate.  We proceed to examples.

### How Plurality Can Address the Gaps

#### Reimagining health insurance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, health insurance is a system for financing healthcare expenditures from a pool of payments made by people facing unequal health risks.  In the presence of risk, *insurance* is any action intended to even out well-being over time.  Note that, in the concept of health insurance, there are *two* insurance functions: i) prepayment and ii) risk pooling.  Prepayment is another term for prudential savings ("a penny for a rainy day"), and its insurance value is evident.  The case for  pooling is more subtle. So long as individual variability in risk is approximately independent, the variations smooth out aggregate (i.e. pooled) well-being and thus make possible the existence of an *insurer*: an agent who enters into contracts with individuals to collect regular premiums and pay out occasional benefits on the occurrence of insured events.  There is a third, socially critical, function of insurance: redistribution from the better to the worse off[^Parfit], which requires a different form of statistical independence. To wit, if individuals' insurance premiums are independent of their health risks, insurance is redistributive: low-risk individuals finance part of the benefits for high-risk ones.  Redistribution is a *pure* insurance function to the extent that those in worse health are so through circumstances that are actually unpredictable.  If this condition is not satisfied, however, redistribution is still a valid insurance function to the extent that the adverse circumstances are *commonly believed* to be unpredictable[^Arrow].  Indeed, many government taxation and expenditure policies, not only for health, as well as the expenditures of charities and altruists, are forms of insurance in at least the latter sense: they express a common belief about the lack of predictability (from, for example, Rawls' original position[^Rawls]) of being born into a particular jurisdiction, socioeconomic stratum, or family circumstances, or with a particular genetic endowment.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health insurance in practice varies along the dimensions of prepayment, risk pooling, and redistribution.  Private insurance in a competitive market faces the problem that insurers with better information can draw off lower-risk individuals by charging less, leaving the non-discriminating insurer with only an 'adverse selection'[^Arrow].  *Private health insurance* in a market economy thus tends to reduce to an actuarially informed *health savings plan* (i.e. no risk pooling or redistribution), and at the limit of this logic health savings accounts (HSAs) are managed by individuals themselves, such as in the United States[^GovWeb].  This, however, voids the HSA of most of its insurance value, including that of prudential savings, since individuals cannot calibrate their savings rates without actuarial information.  At the maximal extreme, *national health insurance* financed from general government revenues, and enacted through a compulsory and universal mandate, embodies the three elements of prepayment, risk pooling, and redistribution.  The problem is that both private and national health insurance have ossified into ideological poles that do not reflect either the potential diversity of insurance mechanisms or the actual diversity of local context and needs.  There is no prior reason to expect that social solidarity should emerge in only two stereotypical forms, nor therefore that its corresponding expression in insurance should.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the main alternative to private or national health insurance, which precedes them both in practice if not theory, is *social health insurance*, forms of which were used in the ancient Roman *collegia*, a type of mutual-aid society arising from an organic expression of commonality.  Modern forms of social health insurance emphasize the shared responsibility of a community of individuals for its members' healthcare costs and thus supplement individual, usually risk-adjusted prepayments, with  collectivized contributions, usually not risk adjusted, from the employer (formerly, from the guilds, such as the medieval German *knappschaften*) and/or from another actor such as the state.  Most health systems in the world predominantly follow either the social or the national insurance model, although private health insurance can be found virtually everywhere.  Somewhat confusingly, current debates in health financing deprecate the practices (typical to social health insurance) of i) financing healthcare costs from a tax on wages assessed through payroll deductions and ii) limiting entitlement to those who contribute such payments through the formal sector.  Although there is certainly merit in these criticisms, it is useful to interrogate the historical origins of the social insurance model in the context of the plurality project: there is a valid sense in which individuals who share a particular profession, or employer, and who therefore tend to share a common set of beliefs and values, should manifest a sense of solidarity (which Durkheim called *mechanical*) that is particularly acute.  

Accordingly, we reimagine health insurance as a 'plural good' (compare the discussion on public goods in Markets 05-07). A plural good is similar to a network good but with a characteristic size that depends on both the size and the connectedness of the network of users/producers; that is, it is a good that builds on the strength of common belief across the diverse scales and shapes embodied by plural publics (see Association and Plural Publics 04-02).  Of particular note is that the social model of health insurance began with the simple fact of 'association', namely, the creation of a shared space for the enactment of common belief, a space shielded from full public surveillance and financed by mechanisms of plural funding (see Markets 05-07 and From Plurality to Reality 06-01).  In the plural conception, therefore, health insurance premiums might be employed to contract directly for the provision of interventions producing the *conditions required for* health, rather than merely, as now, for the payment of services to treat disease or infirmity after arising[^Hanson].  Health insurance might then look more like life insurance, and, as Hanson also notes, there is no strong reason for the two to be segmented and several strong reasons for them not to be.  Essentially, such a fund could act as a mutual-aid society to foster coordination in the joint production of health rather than merely in its restoration: not just 'healthy minds in healthy bodies' but also healthy persons in healthy families and communities (see Figure 1, above).  Like national health insurance, health production societies prioritize prepayment, risk pooling and redistribution but do so at multiple scales not necessarily related to jurisdiction.  In certain cases, a health production society might be formed to ensure the provision of clean water, sanitation, or adequate nutrition (such as the UNDP, UN-Water or the World Food Programme), or to address global infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV or tuberculosis (such as the Global Fund), or to purchase vaccines for children in lower-income countries (such as Gavi).  But in cases relevant to those living in rich countries, a health production society might instead promote health agency through education and social support (e.g. online communities of practice on the *Strava* model) in order to counteract prevalent determinants of poor health such as tobacco use, alcohol misuse, the consumption of ultra-processed foods, and the burning of fossil fuels.  Though together these four determinants account for more than 20 million global deaths per year[^LancetCommDet], i.e. they are twice as fatal as COVID, there is as yet no evidence of a commensurate response against our commercially determined pandemics.  The lack of action is clearly not due to a technical barrier but rather a mental and social one.  Plural technologies can in principle escape both public (i.e. state) and private (i.e. commercial) capture through privacy enhancing technologies (see Association and Plural Publics 04-02) allowing for cryptographically secure, and, if required, anonymized, means of collaboration and governance such as, for example *pol.is* or *Gov4Git* (see From Plurality to Reality 06-01).  Plural technologies also allow for collective action in health to occur at the *right scale*, through a principle of subsidiarity that emerges organically from affinities based on the shared experience of health problems, through funding pools aligned around a standardized set of health impact indicators.  (We discuss health impact in the next section.)  In the current environment, however, there is limited ability for funders of health services to discover or engage with a diverse set of organizations that either provide healthcare services or create the necessary conditions for healthy flourishing; there is also a limited ability for implementers of health interventions, or their beneficiaries, to identify and access relevant streams of financing.  Plural health associations would not replace existing institutions, such as national health systems, international health agencies, or private health philanthropies, but they would fill an important know/do gap at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scales.  All early forms of 'insurance', not merely those for health, involved prepayment, risk pooling, and redistribution by and for people sharing common beliefs who banded together to produce a specific 'public good', whether a professional one such as reliable service in the trades, a religious one such as the observance of feast days and celebrations, the maintenance of social order by the medieval *frith* guilds, or the payment of disability and death benefits by the Roman *collegia* and medieval German *knappschaften*.  Social media communities based on the production of positive-sum social benefits, such as in these historical examples, have so far mainly remained mere ideas, overshadowed perhaps by the massive scale of online disinformation promoting what is in effect collective action contrary to the production of health and the consequent disempowerment, doubt and resulting stasis (e.g. the massive rise in vaccine hesitancy since COVID-19).  Recreating the spirit of the guilds with plural technologies that bridge profession, place, and parentage in the service of health action will open new avenues for healthy human flourishing.

#### Health impact tokenization

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of this discussion, *outputs* are the direct result of health services (e.g. people vaccinated); *outcomes* are the final intended result (e.g. deaths avoided through morbidity or mortality risk reduction); and *impacts* are the knock-on effects that outcomes have in the world at large (e.g. future children born).  Impact is thus an open-source commodity; it can be forked to whatever use the beneficiary can devise (Figure 2).  Although impacts are a *causal* effect of health services (e.g. a child who otherwise would have died did not, and then went on to be a parent), impacts are not the primary *intended* effect of health services.  The  primary intended effect of health services is reducing morbidity or mortality risk, which as we have seen is an insurance function.  Health services, which produce both non-market-traded outcomes (e.g. lives saved *and* healthier lives, through the insurance function) and both market-traded and non-market-traded impacts (e.g. more labour to sell *and* more time for visits with friends, through the open-source function), thus have an accounting problem: it is hard to measure the value of outcomes (e.g. the value of a life saved) but it is often still harder to measure the value of relevant impacts.  Thus, since the full social value of health projects (i.e. the value of outcomes plus the value of impacts) is in practice never counted, let alone captured or rendered tradeable, many win-win investments remain blocked.  This is, in effect, merely a restatement of the public-goods problem, a problem that - as at present - results in a health-financing market oriented around closing the barn door only *after* the horse has bolted: since outcomes are mainly non-market traded and impacts are diffuse, unpredictable, hard to capture, and expensive to take to scale (because of their high fixed costs, compare the discussion on increasing returns in Markets 05-07), pro-health interventions do not make an attractive investment in spite of their universally recognized value.  This is even more true at international level, which explains why transformational successes in health have been limited to those noted at the outset and have often required, as in more than half of the examples, a bespoke financing and governance mechanism.

![Figure 2 - Some Pathways to Impact](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rdl_kNMjs_dL60zztME8FnX1_pwlFXHd/view?usp=sharing/fig_2.PNG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the Global Fund claims to have saved 44 million lives over 20 years at a cumulative cost of $55.4 billion of disbursements plus approximately $6 billion in cumulative operating costs.  These costs have been financed through funds primarily derived from state-collected tax revenues that are pooled in successive 'replenishment rounds', where governments (and some philanthropies) make pledges of support.  Median estimates for the insurance value of a mortality risk reduction of this scale would come in at about $200 trillion dollars, attributing to the Global Fund an (undiscounted) outcomes-based return on investment (ROI) of over 3000:1.  Accordingly, if the Global Fund could have captured even a fraction of the insurance value of the outcomes it directly and intentionally produced, it would be one of the most valuable corporate entities in the world today, and everyone would want to buy its shares.  In fact, everyone in the world already *does* own shares in the Global Fund; however, these shares are a non-tradeable asset and were distributed *gratis* as a pure public function, i.e. with no differentiation or segmentation (no incentive compatibility) for either costs and benefits.  We each benefit in our own way, not only due to the insurance value of globally lower rates of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria but also (and in large part) from the derivative impacts that 44 million people who otherwise would have died were able to realize in the world, for example, contributing to the rise in incomes in low- and middle-income countries from $6 trillion per year in 2002 to $36 trillion per year in 2022 (in constant dollars).  Aside from the massive insurance value, conservatively estimated here at $200 trillion dollars, there is thus an additional quite significant impact value.  One component of impact value is the rise in real incomes everywhere; yet there are still other impacts that are objectively measurable but hard to value, such as better performance in social roles.  Many subjective impacts, however, will be hard even in principle to measure and harder still to value (e.g. happy families).  Consequently, representing and capturing in a tradeable way *just a tiny fraction* of the open-source value of health investments would make the Global Fund possibly the most attractive investment in the world for private capital.  How might such incentive compatibility be realized?[^Disc]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *First*, represent and capture not only the insurance value of health projects (i.e. in terms of their mortality and morbidity risk reduction) but also represent and capture part of the open-source value of their broader social impact.  Insurance value and open-source value can be tokenized (i.e. represented as part of a tradeable digital certificate that encodes verifiable project meta-data).  The digital certificate leverages available outcome- and impact-based frameworks, but it also incorporates a bespoke verification function (i.e. an 'oracle') and also a crowd-sourced one.  For the latter, predictive voting (see Association and Plural Publics 04-02), or similar technologies where participants take stakes on the outcome- and impact-value of digital certificates (i.e. tokens), can be used to refine ex-ante estimates of insurance and open-source value.  Participants thus own actual digital shares in the value of the outcome and impacts of health projects.  Users who want to 'fork' impact to a derivative use can thus take an independent stake (i.e. provide private collateral) for bets on the future value that their fork can create.  Tokens can be allocated (by purchase, assignment, or reward) to funders, implementers and beneficiaries.  All health projects thus have access to blended finance without complex negotiations or significant start-up costs.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Second*, coordinate fragmented funders and implementers through open impact pools (Figure 3) that address the shortcomings noted with existing health financing.  Develop an open coordination standard addressing drawbacks of existing health funders.  Tokens can be used to participate in the governance of projects or of the funding pools.  Projects can allocate tokens linked to contributions.  Tokens can be used to participate in governance; to trade and invest; to exchange for selected services; or to fund further projects (Figure 4).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Third*, formalize and automate manual processes through the use of application ecosystems.  Use technology to incentivize health production and to cut the friction costs and lower the high barriers to entry of financing and governance.  Tokens can be bundled and traded, making it as simple to buy health impact as it is to trade carbon credits.  Tokens can be reinvested into projects or used to purchase selected (standardized) health services.  Value can be linked to specific projects or aggregated into blocks, supporting the development of cascading ('fractal') health-impact markets (Figure 5).  

![Figure 5 - Standardization of Impact Pools](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YuL1mA-ES9l9Q89Mav1KzgTgK_4zvOhx/view?usp=sharing/fig_5.PNG)

#### Empowering health agency through shared sense-making

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under current health financing arrangements, there is no direct link connecting funders (who provide financing) either to implementers (who provide governance and/or technical know-how) or to beneficiaries (the 'target population' for the outcomes, and possibly also the impacts).  The current system tries to address these sense-making gaps through the use of publicity agreements and the corollary use of communications, media, and public-relations services.  Together, these services represent some of the centralized analogues of trust, gratitude, respect, and consideration.  However, the framing of sense-making narratives, rather than being conceived as a common project involving all stakeholders, is skewed towards the specific needs of centralized actors with the resources necessary to make substantial investments in dedicated public-relations, media, and communications activities.  Networking, relationship building, and knowledge exchange thus work (mainly unidirectionally) to serve the interests of those with significant market and non-market power (compare Markets 05-07). Furthermore, these activities need to be highly customized and built 'made to order' when they could be formalized according to a set of community-determined standards.  

#### Incentivizing equitable benefit sharing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health insurance consists of  pooled mechanisms for the prepayment for health services that reduce mortality or morbidity risk, with a flexible element of benefit and risk redistribution.  Benefit sharing in particular has bedevilled blended-finance agreements that promised to mobilize additional sources of funds from private, profit-seeking actors; instead of mobilizing new sources of funding, however, existing arrangements have tended to allow private investors to capture the benefits of public de-risking while offering little or no financial incentive to ensure the active engagement of direct (or indirect) beneficiaries or to reward the commitment of, for example, biological, behavioural, or other services by stakeholders and participants.  Open impact pools that allow for broad participation in governance, including by beneficiaries themselves, and therefore also a broader entitlement to benefits through productizing benefit classes (e.g. tradeable benefits based on defined outcomes and impacts) in a predictable way, can more equitably distribute both risk and benefit and help incentivize the at-scale production of key plural goods.  

#### Participatory governance of health action

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of democracy requires that all stakeholders (a partial list includes funders, intermediaries, implementers, and beneficiaries) of health interventions should be able to opt-in to a set of participatory and transparent governance processes such as quadratic voting (see Voting 05-06) that allow for voice in proportion to (some function of) both standing and values.  Currently, co-decision making processes need to be worked out arduously and at great expense.  Funders can have little or no influence over the strategies and activities of implementers without making massive investments.  Beneficiaries are usually conceived of as the passive recipients (i.e. the 'target') of the actions of funders and implementers, and are accorded little or no voice in projects.  Blended-finance and impact-investing solutions have not developed a core set of standards for engaging stakeholders and participants.  Plural infrastructures providing governance solutions packaged with financing vehicles offer a clear solution.  A lot of the development around plural-goods financing concerns designing data ontologies to represent and capture both outcomes and impact (e.g. HyperCerts, Open Source Observer, Ethereum Attestation Service) but also addressing the need for collaborative governance that can scale-up coordination around the production of outcomes and impacts, even hard to measure ones (e.g. Gitcoin Grants, the Optimism Collective, this book).  

#### Deliberative tools for health cooperation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world has experienced an increasing wave of pandemics, with 6 occurring already this century. In circumstances such as those in which COVID-19 emerged, one principle stands out: public health policy must be formulated in the presence of massive uncertainty about basic facts. For example, in early 2020, we knew we were confronted with two important unknowns: Q1. *How long would it take to develop an effective COVID vaccine?* and
Q2. *Would populations tolerate the imposition of social distancing measures?*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK, as in many other settings, we got the answer to both of these questions badly wrong, with disastrous consequences.  For example, policy-makers in the UK were convinced (though for no good reason) that the answer to Q1 was '*At least 18 months*' and that the answer to Q2 was '*No*'.  With hindsight we now know that the correct answer to Q1 in March 2020 was '*About 5 months*' and that the correct answer to Q2 at that time was a clear '*Yes*'.  Yet because there was no concerted effort to elicit what was known about these facts, or what could reasonably be conjectured, we reached mistaken conclusions and *as a direct result* of those errors delayed far too long in imposing social distancing measures.  In the UK, we delayed so long, in fact, that people and organizations themselves - independently and without explicit guidance - started practicing widespread social distancing on Friday 13 March 2020, a full 10 days before the UK authorities officially called for such measures.  The single most important point that stands out from these facts is the following: if diffuse populations of individuals or loosely organized non-health associations, such as soccer clubs, can formulate *objectively better pandemic policy* than a government that is advised by the world's top epidemiological experts, then clearly governments are turning a blind eye to a critical source of information and analysis.  The use of online tools such as expert-elicitation[^Cooke] databases maintained on a variety of collaborative, deliberative, voting or prediction-market (i.e. 'governance') technologies (see Section 5 on Democracy) would have multiplied by orders of magnitude the power of 'the wisdom of the crowd' such as we witnessed in the UK between 10 and 23 March 2020.  Indeed, in the long run, much more important than 'getting policy right' is preserving social cohesion and public engagement with and trust in policy-makers, since without these things 'policy' as such rapidly becomes meaningless.  Taiwan followed a very different path from the UK, with the rapid government support of citizen-led initiatives for, for example, tracking the supply of masks.  By moving quickly to empower citizen-led online initiatives (HackMD, g0v, pol.is), Taiwan was able to harvest the power of localized and contextual knowledge as a plural good without imposing centralized control but also while respecting individual privacy.  The approach has now been institutionalized.  With such clearly contrasting examples as these, it follows that policy during the next novel pandemic is almost certain not to be the sole province or prerogative of epidemiological experts in closed-room consultations.  Plural technologies will be widely used for the large-scale formulation of and coordination around collective action.  

#### Human-centered redesign of healthcare administration through AI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In virtually every part of the world, healthcare is administered through a model originating in various colonizing powers, usually as a mirror of the forms of administration found in their respective imperial centres but with the additional mission of 'development' tacked on.  Development however, is a word which has usually functioned as shorthand for extracting the colony's resources while claiming to act in its interests. India under the Raj is a classic example, but a version of this story can be told everywhere.  To the extent that they dabbled in health matters, the precursor of USAID (i.e. the US Agency for International Aid) and the British Colonial Development Corporation, as well as the French *Fonds d’investissement pour le développement économique et social des territoires d’outremer* (FIDES) all adopted policies whereby "economic growth was the holy grail, and foreign investment and international lending were the path to growth"[^Khalili].  Results have naturally been mixed.  Nevertheless, in a number of former colonies, notably in Canada and Australia, concerted efforts are being made on the part of colonialist successor administrations to learn from Indigeneous models of health and healthcare, to engage in the co-administration of healthcare and other health services in accordance with Indigeneous community values, and to allow for the self-determination of solutions (i.e. 'policy') by Indigeneous peoples.  As these experiments remain few and far between, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as large language models seem a promising tool to leverage the large and diffuse bodies of textual data produced in these initiatives for the purpose of interpreting, criticizing, reimagining, and eventually redesigning, systems of healthcare administration to be more responsive to other cultural value systems.  As discussed in the chapter on Post-Symbolic Communication (05-01),'points of view' that are held (albeit diffusely) by organizations and even entire cultures can be represented as an 'individual' whose 'synthetic wisdom' can be queried in real-time interactions, or who can be tasked with designing incentive-compatible healthcare and interventions along a non-colonialist model.

#### BCIs for health and healthcare

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs, see Post-Symbolic Communication 05-01) are not some futuristic fantasy of science fiction but rather familiar objects in common use.  The usual operating system employed is that of the sensory and motor organs.  Eyeglasses and hearing aids are low bit-rate computing devices that interface (unidirectionally, or write only) with our brains through the sensory organs; canes, crutches and wheelchairs are low bit-rate mechanical computers that interface with the brain bidirectionally (i.e. read/write), through the intermediary of both the sensory and motor organs.  Digital assistive devices, such as smart-phones or portable computers, are (slightly) higher bit-rate devices that interface with the brain (read/write) through the intermediary of the sensory-motor system (usually the visual, hearing and fine-motor systems) but also through higher-order domains of functioning such as speech (e.g voice recognition), cognition (e.g. CAPTCHAs) and memory (e.g. passwords).  These 'BCIs' interact with us through a range of input/output devices including keyboards, (touch)screens and a variety of other read/write BCIs.  Such higher bit-rate digital computing tools have become for many people an indispensable and defining part of what it means for them 'to be human': as anyone who has lost their smartphone knows, the experience is one of significant disability.  It would be futile to insist that such devices are not now an integral part of our (transhuman) personality[^Haraway].  Common applications of such technologies exist in the form of m-health (e.g. text-message alerts, wearable devices, contact-tracing tools), telemedicine and telehealth (e.g. virtual fracture clinics[^Anderson]), and e-health (e.g. digital health records).  It is both natural and obvious that the trend towards further modalities of interactivity, and higher bit-rate throughput, will have in time important novel implications for health, especially for visual, hearing, mobility, self-care, and speech disorders, notably through Extended Reality (XR) services (see next section).  Biomedical engineering is already embarked on the programme of connecting prosthetic devices at cellular level (i.e. bionics)[^James&Laurencin], and BCIs hold out the corollary promise of allowing for such connectivity at cognitive, emotional and experiential level with, for example, powerful applications in speech and communication disorders, in the enhancement (or maintenance) of cognitive functions such as memory and, almost certainly, in novel applications for common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, as well as for impulse control for addictive disorders.  In Post-Symbolic Communication (05-01), we read that "future developments [in BCIs] could allow for the sharing of thoughts, emotions, and experiences directly from one mind to another, allowing for an unprecedented level of interaction."  As we discuss in the next section, this promise has important implications for mental health applications.  

#### Building healthy communities with XR technologies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extended-reality (XR), or immersive, technologies encompass a suite of tools that provide BCI services in a quasi-complete sensory, motor, cognitive and relational (i.e. interpersonal) package. To date, applications for health have been non-interpersonal and used to de-risk medical training for health workers, much as flight simulators do for pilots. It is natural to imagine the gamification of health-based XR so as to incentivize and reward the learning of complex cognitive, relational, and behavioural skills (such as self-care, self-insight, and self-management), as well as a suite of  potential simulated interpersonal applications. See the chapter on Immersive Shared Reality (05-02). Similar to the examples cited there, new horizons of simulated and non-simulated social interaction can be opened to those with disabilities that less immersive, lower-throughput, traditional assistive technologies cannot address. 

####  Big data and neural networks to assist diagnosis and treatment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A human radiographer can at the upwards limit view and interpret perhaps as many one million diagnostic imaging scans during a lifetime of practice.  While this is sufficient to achieve expert status in diagnosing common conditions, neural networks can train on datasets orders of magnitude larger and thus will outperform human readers for the diagnosis of rarely seen conditions, i.e. those with a frequency on the order of 1 in 1,000,000 or lower.  Of course, human beings might specialize in such conditions and therefore dedicate themselves to viewing a collection of many such images, but the need for plural technologies then becomes even more acute: it seems impossible to imagine how large databases of images of rare conditions can be compiled without established data sharing practices across many image collection centres.  In this case too, we see diffuse pockets of diversity that show 'affinity' in terms of markers that cannot be organized into low-entropy pockets based merely on traditional variables such as place, profession, or parentage (see Collaborative Technology and Democracy 05-00); in such cases, another organizing principle must be found, and online technologies are the obvious solution.  Such technologies also need to respect privacy and confidentiality, both as a normative and legal principle. Various forms of privacy enhancing technologies (see Association and Plural Publics 04-02) such as zero- (or low-) knowledge proofs, allow for specific kinds of information to be reliably shared without over-sharing.  In Web2 applications such as Facebook and Google, users 'willingly' share their private information in exchange for the social benefits afforded by the platforms.  That is, even knowing that their private and public information is being harvested for profit by third-party entities, many individuals presumably still find that membership in online Web2 communities offers a net benefit.  What if there was no trade-off between privacy and utility?  What if accessing medical services did not incur an open-ended contingent liability for the privacy of the individual?  Medical administrative data is 'safe' for everyone, until the system is hacked because of, for example, a phishing attack: in the long run, we all face data theft with Web2 systems.  Rethinking medical practice (which requires patient data for the patient's own benefit) and medical research (which requires patient data for the benefit of other patients) so as to build in cryptographic principles from the foundation is an essential part of the Web3 project, with important health implications: no doubt some diseases today are still fatal only because of our failure to build these applications.  Extending the diagnostic example, medical notes of all kinds (e.g. admission, treatment, discharge) forming a part of a patient's medical record are a potentially vast source of information about care and outcomes that is not only highly diffuse and unstructured but also virtually unqueryable outside of a set of specific and highly restricted medicolegal contexts.  If there is a way to extract weak, or highly confounded, signals as the basis for novel causal insights, generative foundation models are perhaps the only technology that might do so.  Variations in medical practice and outcomes alone should in principle make it possible to identify and extract the relevant counterfactual, much as - at population level - regression discontinuity design does. 

### What the Future Holds

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the enormous amount of value currently 'left on the table' by the under-production of health, in our view it is inevitable that digital plural technologies will increasingly be used to:
* Unlock successive layers of value for health funders, implementers, and beneficiaries.
* Attract a broader group of health funders, implementers, and beneficiaries who will want to work with novel mechanisms to coordinate around funding and production of health goods.
* Empower the construction of health-oriented communities of practice by funders, implementers and beneficiaries.
* Ensure the reciprocal, symmetric, and equitable governance of pooled, co-created health assets by funders, implementers and beneficiaries.
* Enable new forms of international, regional and local cooperation in the co-production of health.
* Unlock new avenues for healthy human (and transhuman) functioning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blockers noted above (Lack of financing, Missing markets, Coordination failures, Missing communities, Non-aligned incentives, and Lack of enabling services) will be overcome, and the darkening clouds will dissipate.
