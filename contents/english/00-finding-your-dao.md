# Finding Your Dao


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we discuss in the book, linear book narratives have a significant disadvantage of forcing every reader down a single learning path.  While the online version of avoids this through the extensive use of hyperlinks, those who hold a physical copy will find this more challenging to navigate.  To partially alleviate this problem, we have structured the text in a "circular" manner, where readers can start at a variety of points, read from there and circle back to the "earlier" material at the end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommend in particular that:
- Those with a primarily topical, political or **current affairs** interest begin at the beginning of the book, with the preface and read straight through.
- Those with a more conceptual, theoretical or broadly **intellectual** interest consider skipping Parts 1 and 2 and beginning in Part 3 
- Those with a more **technical**, technological or engineering focus consider beginning with Part 4
- Those with an interest in concrete technologies and their **applications** consider beginning with Part 5
- Those with an interest in real-world **impact** in specific social sectors consider beginning with Part 6
- Those with a focus on public **policy**, government and social mobilization consider beginning with Part 7
Regardless of stating point, we expect most readers who find value wherever they begin will find it worthwhile to continue reading, looping back and filling in the theoretical frameworks of "later" parts of the book with the the material that comes earlier.
