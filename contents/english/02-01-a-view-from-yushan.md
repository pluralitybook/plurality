# A View from Yushan

> Swirling ocean, beautiful islands;<br />
> a transcultural republic of citizens.

Standing at the summit of Yushan, the highest peak in East Asia, one can not only overlook the terrain of Taiwan but also perceive how this small, mountainous island nation is intricately connected to the world. Located at the intersection of the Eurasian and the Pacific tectonic plates, Taiwan's geological fault lines have not only elevated Yushan but have also fostered a diverse and resilient society amid the clash of cultures and values.

Taiwan has combined advanced technology and the plural spirit of the digital realm with the philosophy of broadband human rights and social resilience, transforming them into tools that promote inter-group connectivity and warmth. This is confirmed by Taiwan's role in the global digital network topology: Not just a "republic of citizens" but also a global carrier of diverse values and the spirit of collaboration.

In recent years, the global landscape has entered an era of multi-polar ideological divisions, especially in a post-pandemic world rife with uncertainty. This shift not only highlights the importance of digital technology but also reminds us that, when facing phenomena like polarized divisions and fragmented information, global society needs more proactive, open, and inclusive forms of actionable democratic dialogue, allowing the international community to reassess and adjust global governance structures.

In response to the multipolar authoritarianism and social fractures, our answer is a form of understated yet resolute pacifism—an action guide based on steadfast faith and the pursuit of coexistence. The true diversity and inclusion we seek allows for every voice to be heard and seen and penetrates the surface illusion of complex issues to create a collaborative consensus.

Important milestones in Taiwan's digital democracy include the 318 Sunflower Movement, the establishment of PDIS, and the Digital Ministry. Open dialogues between the government and civil society, along with active participation from multiple stakeholders, have proven that "digital democracy" is not only feasible but can also be innovative in turning conflicts into co-creations.

The world faces numerous challenges, including pandemics, climate crises, and inequality. Yet, like Yushan, Taiwan is becoming a supporting force in tackling these issues through its spirit of diversity and openness. As the preface of this book says, "The advent of the internet unfurled the world, illuminating paths forward," it also reflects the contours of Taiwan. This island nation's significant contributions to global society make it an indomitable force that cannot be ignored.
