# Immersive Shared Reality

Immersive shared reality technologies unlocks a new chapter in human interaction, leveraging cutting-edge virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) systems. Unlike the deeply personal and sensorially rich exchanges of post-symbolic communication, shared immersive reality presents a broader canvas for human interaction, enabling people to engage in shared, multisensory experiences. This chapter delves into the landscape of immersive technologies, today’s applications, tomorrow’s potential, and the frontier. It shows how immersive technologies may facilitate shared experiences that blend physical and virtual reality, complementing and expanding human experience with interactions that surpass physical, spatial and social limitations. Shared immersive reality creates spaces where communities may converge for socialization, gaming, entertainment, and more, facilitating connections that, while less intense than symbolic communication, are meaningful and emotionally resonant. From virtual reality gatherings that unite people across the globe, to mass online gaming and virtual music festivals, these digital arenas extend the possibility space of shared human experience.

On the horizon, shared immersive reality is poised for rapid expansion. Technological advancements will deepen the sensory integration of these virtual experiences, extending beyond sight and sound to include touch, smell, and even taste. This future, teeming with hybrid reality environments and emotional connectivity heralds a new era of human interaction, where digital spaces not only simulate reality but enhance it, bridging divides and fostering broader understanding. However, immersive reality also has its perils. From the widening surveillance to virtual escapism, these challenges demand thoughtful consideration to ensure that our digital futures augment, rather than diminish, the richness of human experience. 

TODAY

Immersive Shared Reality refers to technology that creates a shared virtual environment where users can interact in real-time. This type of “reality” can be considered a subset application of Mediated Reality, a broader term that encompasses various technologies that mediate our perception of reality, including Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality (a.k.a. VR, AR, MR).

### Shared reality today

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immersive Shared Reality refers to the use of technology to create a shared virtual environment where users can interact with each other in real-time. This type of “reality” can be considered a subset application of Mediated Reality, a broader term coined by Steve Mann back in the 90’s. Mediated Reality encompasses various technologies that mediate our perception of reality, including Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality (a.k.a. VR, AR, MR). Some of the most common applications are related to gaming, entertainment, art, healthcare, and education, which are often also immersive, shared realities.

Today’s immersive shared reality is a vibrant mix of entertainment, art, and collaboration, from virtual concerts and online multiplayer gaming to remote team-building exercises and virtual tourism. Artists like Billie Eilish have already held virtual concerts that draw crowds into the pulsating heart of her music, or music festivals like Coachella have embraced the benefits of VR without the constraints of physical venues (e.g., selling out). Such shared experiences, like in online multiplayer gaming, create worlds where players not only compete but also form lasting friendships that break the boundaries of the virtual-physical divide. Remote team-building exercises, rendered through VR, turn colleagues separated by oceans into teammates in a shared digital space, fostering team spirit and camaraderie. Through virtual tourism, travelers can experience remote places, walking through historic cities or visiting foreign landscapes without leaving their homes.

But more than amusement, these platforms also create spaces for shared understanding and empathy across cultures and distances, promoting emotional connection and awareness among people who are far apart.  For example, language learning applications use these to immerse users in the linguistic and cultural background of others, while virtual reality therapy sessions offer healing and comfort to those with mental health challenges. Each of these examples encapsulates a unique facet of how Immersive Shared Realities can meld entertainment with deeper social connections. As these technologies mature, they are increasingly harnessed to not just simulate reality but to enhance it, creating a bridge between diverse cultures and fostering a global community of shared experiences and mutual understanding regardless of one’s origin or language.  

### Remote shared reality tomorrow

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerging technologies on the horizon promise to deepen the immersive experience and reshape human interaction by enveloping users in a synthetic world that simulates multiple senses simultaneously. While sight and sound have been the traditional focus, the integration of touch, smell, and even taste is beginning to enhance the immersive experience.  The horizon of immersive shared reality gleams with potential, foreshadowing a tomorrow where multisensory integration is not an exception but a norm. New sensors and actuators promise to deepen the immersive experience by synthetic worlds that not only replicate but enhance all senses.

Audio-visual interfaces have long been the vanguard senses in the digital realm; thus, the frontier is now expanding to include touch, facilitated by advanced haptic feedback systems that replicate the subtleties of physical contact. Smell, once considered elusive in the digital domain, is now being captured by olfactory technology, enabling fragrances and odors to be part of storytelling, education, and even retail experiences in VR. Taste, though still in nascent stages, is beginning to make its mark through taste retargeting [^TasteRetargeting], hinting at a future where dining can be a shared virtual adventure by altering taste perception delivering chemical modulators to the mouth before eating. 

This multisensory expansion is not merely for enhancement but serves a higher purpose of fostering inclusivity and equality within immersive spaces. For instance, hyper-realistic social VR platforms are being designed with accessibility in mind, allowing those with visual or auditory impairments to engage through other senses. Virtual chambers are being designed where people who are fare away from one another can converse as if in the same room. For instance, the Portals Policing Project [^MultisensoryIntegration] exemplifies how Immersive Shared Realities can serve the public good by sharing the lived experiences of people with law enforcement in a controlled, yet realistic virtual chamber, improving understanding and trust on both sides. On similar lines, the Tree Project [^PortalsPolicingProject] demonstrates how immersive VR can evoke empathy and compassion for the natural environment by transforming the user into a rainforest tree and exposing them to the threats of deforestation and climate change. 

### Frontiers of Immersive Shared Reality

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At the frontiers of Immersive Shared Reality, we are not merely spectators but active participants in a revolution of multisensory integration [^TreeProject]. As Mediated Reality technologies advance, the precision with which sensory modalities are replicated and introduced into virtual experiences will improve, allowing for a more sophisticated and controlled use of non-traditional sensory inputs like the sense of smell and taste. This careful curation of olfactory and haptic stimuli, when combined with visual and auditory, can create a compelling illusion of reality that deeply resonates with the users’ emotions and memories. Such stimuli, when reactivated during sleep, not only can enhance these memories [^OlfactoryWearables], but simulate worlds through sensory stimulation in altered states of consciousness [^DreamEngineering], such in a shared lucid dream [^RealtimeDreamDialogue].

The importance of such integration speaks to the broader objectives of immersive shared realities – creating experiences that are not merely escapes from reality but are extensions of it, enhancing users’ understanding of and engagement with important global issues such as the critical arena of climate change, providing a platform for not just awareness but active participation in sustainability efforts. Virtual environments can simulate the stark realities of climate change, such as rising sea levels or the impact of extreme weather events, making the abstract and often distant concepts an immediate and personal experience. These immersive simulations are not scare tactics but educational tools that engage users emotionally and cognitively, fostering a deeper understanding of the environmental consequences of human actions. This can be particularly powerful when using affective computing within these realities, where the system will adapt the environment based on the user’s response, physiology as well as memories or preferences, creating a feedback loop that heightens awareness and empathy for climate issues. 

Now, consider the potential of such immersive experiences to drive environmental advocacy and the act of communal creation. In a virtual design studio, community members, architects, and engineers come together to co-create the green spaces of tomorrow. The process transcends mere planning; participants can feel and empathize with such environment and virtually touch the bark of trees slated for planting and inhale the fragrant blossoms intended for the gardens, forging a visceral connection to the project long before the first seed is sown in the physical world. Imagine a scenario where, after such collaborative design process in immersive shared reality, the community’s vision is not only transformed into detailed 3D models but then brought to life using large-scale 3D printers, capable of printing with local biomaterials that are abundant, recyclable, and have a minimal carbon footprint. The process draws on the principles of circular economy, where the materials used can be sourced, utilized, and eventually returned to the earth without generating waste.

The 3D printing of homes and community structures offers a radical departure from traditional construction methods. Automated printers, guided by precise digital schematics produced from the immersive shared reality sessions, layer the biomaterials to create walls and architectural features with a speed and efficiency that traditional methods cannot match. This process significantly reduces construction waste and allows for complex, organic designs that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional building techniques. The concept of “printing” a community from the collective imagination of its future inhabitants is not as far-fetched as it once seemed.

Immersive shared reality serves as a powerful design tool, allowing residents to co-create their living spaces in a virtual environment. Such worlds will contribute to the formation of shared experiences and collective memory and will situate this evolving technology within the new era of post-symbolic communication described in the previous chapter.

### Limits of Immersive Shared Reality

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its promise, immersive shared reality faces a wide variety of ethical dilemmas and societal challenges that could undermine the principles of Plurality. We confront potential issues such as the risk of virtual escapism and the dilution of real-world activism, potential for addition or the neglect of physical world responsibilities and relationships. As virtual experiences verge on becoming indistinguishable from our tangible reality, the risks of addiction and the potential for neglecting the physical world's demands become palpable concerns. The seductive allure of these digital realms could precipitate a form of virtual escapism, where the lines between authentic activism and simulated advocacy blur, possibly diluting the vigor of real-world change efforts.

Addressing these concerns requires a careful embedding of ethical and democratic principles within the very fabric of virtual communities. Drawing from insights presented in other chapters, the integration of participatory governance systems, like democratic voting mechanisms, into virtual environments offers a promising approach. Such systems can ensure that individuals remain grounded and accountable, preserving a balance between digital engagement and their real-world roles and responsibilities. By fostering a culture of active citizenship and responsible stewardship within these platforms, we can work towards safeguarding the plurality and diversity that form the cornerstone of vibrant societies.
