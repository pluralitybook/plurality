# Finding your dao


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we discuss in the book, linear book narratives have a significant disadvantage of forcing every reader down a single learning path.  While the online version of avoids this through the extensive use of hyperlinks, those who hold a physical copy will find this more challenging to navigate.  To partially alleviate this problem, we have structured the text in a "circular" manner, where readers can start at a variety of points, read from there and circle back to the "earlier" material at the end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommend in particular that:
- Those with a primarily topical, political or current affairs interest begin at the beginning of the book, with the preface and read straight through.
- Those with a more conceptual, theoretical or broadly intellectual interest consider skipping Parts 1 and 2 and beginning in Part 3 with the chapter What is â¿»?
